For people with little or no knowledge of app development, AI is a useful tool. Depending on your expertise, AI can be used as part of the app development process, or for complete app development using Vibe Coding.

The web app can be as simple as using [Gradio](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-gradio), a bit more complex like [Streamlit](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-streamlit), [FastAPI + Docker](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-docker-first-demo), Dash (Plotly), or Shiny, and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for free on the minimum machine.

The app components can be databases, authentication, payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Polar), webhooks, deployment (Vercel, Linode (Akamai)).

### Vibe Coding

Vibe Coding means that 100% of the code is generated by AI.

Check security vulnerability checklists before deployment:

The tools and definitions presented below will most likely be outdated soon.

#### Examples:

- Using API by Copy & Pasting: ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity, DeepSeek
- AI-Enhanced IDEs & Dev Platforms: Cursor, Windsurf, Replit, Cline, v0 (Vercel), Devika, GitHub Copilot (Microsoft), Gemini Code Assist (Google)
- Agentic AI Developer Agents & APIs: GitHub Spark, Codex (OpenAI), Claude Code (Anthropic), Gemini CLI (Google), Firebase Studio (Google), Devin (Cognition Labs), Aider, Kiro (Amazon)
- Fully web-based platforms: Lovable (React), Tempo AI, Bolt.new, Databutton (Python + React)

#### Definitions

- AI-Enhanced IDEs & Dev Platforms: Code-first environments—either forks of VS Code or integrated development platforms—that embed AI directly into your editor or workspace, letting you write, refactor, and run code via natural-language instructions.
- Agentic AI Developer Agents & APIs: Standalone “agent” tools and LLM-powered services—accessed via CLI, API, or cloud console—that can plan features, implement code changes, run tests, and even deploy pull requests.
- Fully web-based platforms: No-install, browser-only services that let non-technical users—and developers—prototype and deploy full-stack apps via visual UIs and text prompts.

### Deployment

Hugging Face, Google Colab, University infrastructure (SURF Research Cloud), Vercel, Linode

### Tools

- Frontend (Client-Side): HTML/CSS/JS, React (JavaScript)
- Backend (Server-Side): Python (Django; FastAPI + Fly.io style), Node.js (JavaScript)
- Design: Figma; Bootstrap templates and themes
- Full-stack front- or back-end: Next.js
